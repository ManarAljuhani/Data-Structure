Problem Statement:

 A Library Assistant is a self-billing system that can help in many book devices and shops, or any other self-billing policy.
 It is basically a system that deal with the current highly speed information processing movement, by dealing with each client easily and only once for each duration. Beside, keep tracing the total process and delete deponed in the user choice. 
once the Bill printed all the data disappear except the total tracing. The idea of self-billing will reduce the effort, and time . 




Explanation of data structure used:


In order to keep tracing the continues process of borrowing from the machine I used the stack , the functionality of  first in last out ease saving the semi-old data, which is not important for user but  pretty valuable for the system owner.
It's also useful in the privacy situation  if the user doesn’t want to keep his data, once the bill printed everything will gone. 
In the other hand due to its fast insertion and deletion it will be better than the usual array process, less complexity since each process will take only O(1) !
The ArrayList will provide an efficient solution of the space problem in the bigger projects …
